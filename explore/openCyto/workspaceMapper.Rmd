# Mapping workspace to individual fcs files for correlation metrics


```{r collect,eval=TRUE,fig.width=10,fig.height=8}
library(openCyto)
library(ggcyto)
library(flowCore)
outDir = "/home/pankrat2/shared/bin/auto-fcs/explore/openCyto/"

  # print(paste(file,"\t",s[2]$name))
  tmp = data.frame(

)
  
  df = rbind(df,tmp)
}

write.table( df,file = paste(outDir,"fcsMSIMap.txt",sep = ""),sep = "\t",quote = FALSE,row.names = FALSE)
```



for samples in ws:

print ws file, sample


load and gate for sample, 

plot proportions for auto and manual
